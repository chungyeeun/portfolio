                    I'm Yeeun chung, just call me yeni.
                    <br>I'm a Junior Front-end Developer.
                    I'm currently looking for a job that requires my skills.
                    I have no experience in development, but with thorough preparation and smooth communication, 
                    I will be what people need.<br>
                    <br>Let me tell you something interesting.ðŸ˜Š<br>
                    I worked as a floral designer for seven years, I love flowers, flowers are already beautiful, but I designed them to be more beautiful. 
                    To make something beautiful is to be happy to me.<br>
                    One day, I happened to see the developers working that was so cool.
                    I thought I wanted to work like them, and I interested in software.and started studying development.
                    I don't think designing flowers and developing front-end is much different.
                    Because it's the same thing to make flowers more beautiful to satisfy customers and to providing a convenient user experience of a good program,isn't it?<br>
                    If I'm curious, shall we talk about the details when we meet?
                    <br>English is not my first language, so it's a little hard to speak English like a native speaker.but I promise to be the developer you need.<br>
                    <br>Thanks for stopping by!
